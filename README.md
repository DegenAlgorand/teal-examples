Examples and best practices for Algorand Teal smart contract development.

## Algorand Service Contract Examples

### Tinyman

The Tinyman folder contains an example of their new Tinyman v1.1 contracts. It supports Teal 4.

This example is straight from the Github account and contains code comments and the full original code. Unlike the next two examples, it has not been decompiled from the block chain.

### AB2

The AB2 folder contains an example of a decompiled Teal 2 contract for their NFT marketplace. This contract is viewable when listing an NFT on their platform. Due to the fact that this is the decompiled version, it will be harder to read than an original copy.

### Yieldly

The Yieldly example contains an example of their Teal 5 staking pool smart contract. Like the AB2 example, it is decompiled code found using AlgoExplorer.
